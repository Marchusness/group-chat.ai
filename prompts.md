What ive built is a website where users can create ai characters and have them debate a topic in the aim of finding the best answer.

Lets jump into a demo.

this can behave like a normal chatbot. you can ask it questions and it will answer you.

when you want information about a very specific topic you can ask the character you think is best suited to answer the question
whats your one piece of advice for a starting entrepreneur
i think steve jobs would be a good character to ask that question

Should i make a website where a user can create ai characters and have them debate a topic in the aim of finding the best answer? is it feasable? does it have a market? does it have a good business models and value proposition? should i persure this idea or should i explore other ideas? please provide an answer if i should persure this idea or not i want to make the most impact with my work and time and im not sure if this is the best idea to do that with.
